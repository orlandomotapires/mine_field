## About 🤔:

In this JAVA project, we have utilized the principles of object-oriented programming to create an engaging version of the game as part of an evaluative activity for the LP1 (Programming Language 1) course taught at SENAI CIMATEC in 2022.1.

The objective of the Minesweeper game is to uncover all the cells on the grid without detonating any mines. You'll need to use your logical thinking and deduction skills to strategically flag cells that potentially contain mines.

## Resourses 🧑‍🔬:

- Visual Interface: The project has a graphical user interface (GUI) that provides a visual representation of the game.

- Restart Functionality: The game allows the user to restart or reset the game at any point, giving them the option to start over.

- Recursive Logic for Opening Squares: The squares in the game open in a recursive manner, meaning that when a square is opened, it may trigger the opening of neighboring squares based on a logical rule.

- Visual Feedback on Surrounding Bombs: The user receives visual feedback about the number of bombs surrounding a particular square. This information helps the user make strategic decisions while playing the game.

- Win/Loss Visual Feedback: The user is visually notified when they win or lose the game, indicating the outcome of their gameplay.

- Remaining Bombs Indicator: The game provides information on how many bombs are left to be discovered, giving the user a sense of progress and completion.

- Flag Placement on Bombs: The user can place flags on the squares where they suspect bombs to be located. This feature helps the user mark potential bomb locations for better gameplay strategy.

- Selectable Difficulty: The game allows the user to choose the difficulty level from options such as easy, medium, and hard. Each difficulty level presents different challenges and adjustments in the gameplay, offering a customizable experience for players of varying skill levels.
